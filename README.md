## Problem Statement and Identification
Our objective is to develop a program which accepts a text file's name from the user and processes it. If the file is not found, then it prints an error message, else it proceeds to produce a concordance: an alphabetical listing of unique words and their respective frequencies in the text file. This is stored in an output file and is also displayed on the output screen.
